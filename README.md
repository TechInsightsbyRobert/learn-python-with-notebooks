## 🚀 Getting Started

This course is designed to be completed **directly on Kaggle**, using interactive Jupyter Notebooks. No installation is required — just a browser and a Kaggle account.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Open a Lesson Notebook

Click on any lesson link in the **Course Structure** table above.  
This will take you to the lesson’s page on Kaggle.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Click “Copy & Edit”

Once the notebook opens on Kaggle:

1. Look to the **top-right corner** of the page
2. Click the **“Copy & Edit”** button

This creates **your own editable copy** of the notebook so you can:
- Run code
- Edit cells
- Save your progress

⚠️ If you don’t click **Copy & Edit**, you won’t be able to make changes.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Running Code Cells

Each lesson contains code cells you can run.

To run a cell:
- Click inside the cell
- Press **Shift + Enter**

This runs the code and moves to the next cell automatically.

---

### ⌨️ Helpful Keyboard Shortcuts (Beginner-Friendly)

These shortcuts will make your learning smoother:

- **Shift + Enter** → Run the current cell
- **Ctrl + Enter** → Run the cell (stay on it)
- **Esc** → Exit edit mode
- **Enter** → Edit a selected cell
- **B** → Add a new cell *below*
- **A** → Add a new cell *above*

Don’t worry about memorizing these — use them as you get comfortable 😊

---

### ✍️ Step 4: Practice in “Your Turn” Cells

Whenever you see a **“Your Turn”** section:
- Add a **new code cell**
- Try writing the code yourself
- Experiment — breaking code is part of learning!

You learn best by **doing**, not just reading.

---

### 💾 Step 5: Saving Your Work

Kaggle automatically saves your notebook, but you can also:
- Click **Save Version**
- Add a note like *“Finished Lesson 3”*

This helps you track progress over time.

---

### 🎯 Final Tip

Take your time. Run the code. Change values. Ask “what if?”  
That curiosity is how programmers grow 🚀

You’re officially ready to start learning Python — enjoy the journey!
