    "# Lesson 7: Mini Project 🎉🐍\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to **LearnTech with Robert**!  \n",
    "You’ve learned a lot over the past lessons — variables, conditionals, loops, functions, lists, and dictionaries. Now it’s time to **put it all together** and build a small, interactive program. This is your chance to **practice everything you’ve learned** in a fun, creative way!\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini projects help you **see how concepts work together** in real programs. By doing this, you’ll build confidence and start thinking like a real programmer 💪\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 What You’ll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine variables, conditionals, loops, and functions\n",
    "- Build a small interactive Python program\n",
    "- Use lists and dictionaries to store data\n",
    "- Customize a project to your liking\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Planning Your Mini Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "Before writing code, it’s important to **plan what your program will do**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself:\n",
    "- What is the program for? (e.g., a quiz, a to-do list, a simple game)\n",
    "- What inputs will the user give?\n",
    "- What outputs will the program show?\n",
    "- Which Python concepts will you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "Planning keeps your code organized and helps you avoid confusion. Even professional developers plan before coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Task 1: Define the Program’s Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide what your interactive program will do (e.g., quiz, calculator, guessing game)\n",
    "- Write down a list of actions the program will perform\n",
    "- Identify which Python concepts (variables, loops, functions, conditionals) you will use\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠What’s happening?\n",
    "- You’re thinking like a programmer\n",
    "- Planning makes writing code easier\n",
    "- You’ll know which tools to use before typing anything\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✏️ Your Turn\n",
    "1. Choose a program idea\n",
    "2. List the main steps your program will follow\n",
    "3. Identify at least 3 Python concepts you will use  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: Keep it simple but interactive*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Setting Up the Program Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A program works best when **broken into sections**:\n",
    "1. Gather input from the user\n",
    "2. Process the input using logic and loops\n",
    "3. Show output\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are great for **grouping tasks** and avoiding repetitive code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing code makes it readable, easier to debug, and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Task 2: Create Functions for Your Program\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet_user():\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to my mini project!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_input():\n",
    "    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "    return name\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 🧠 What’s happening?\n",
    "- `greet_user()` handles the welcome message\n",
    "- `get_input()` asks the user's naame and returns it\n",
    "- Functions keep your code **clean and modular**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✏️ Your Turn\n",
    "1. Write a function to greet the user\n",
    "2. Write another function to ask for a user input\n",
    "3. Call bboth functions in order\n"
