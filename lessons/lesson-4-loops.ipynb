    "# Lesson 4: Loops 🔁\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to **LearnTech with Robert**!  m\n",
    "So far, you’ve written Python code that runs **top to bottom, one line at a time*. Thaat's great — but what if you want to repeat an action many times without rewriting the same code over and over?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's exactly where loops come in!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 What You’ll Learn in This Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What loops are and why they exist\n",
    "- How for loops work\n",
    "- How **while loops** work\n",
    "- What range() does and why it's useful\n",
    "- What a loop counter is and how it changes during a loop \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔂 What Is a Loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop is a way to tell python:\n",
    "> “Run this block of code more thaan once.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of copying and pasting the same code 10 times, you can use a loop to do the repetition for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Why This Matters\n",
    "Loops are everywhere in programming:\n",
    "- Repeating actions (printing, calculating, checking)\n",
    "- working with lists of data\n",
    "- Counting, scoring, or tracking progress\n",
    "- Automating boring or repetitve tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to write efficient and powerful code, loops are essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 🔂 For Loops\n",
    "### 🧠 What Is a `for` Loop?\n",
    "A for loop is used when you know how many times you want something to repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "You are telling Pyhton:\n",
    "> “For each value in a sequence, do this.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why Beginners Use `for` Loops\n",
    "- They are predictable and easy to read\n",
    "- Greate for counting or repeating steps\n",
    "- Very common in beginner projects and data work\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## ✅ Task 1: Your First `for` Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 🧠 What’s happening?\n",
    "- `range(5) creates the numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
    "- The loop runs once for each number\n",
    "- The variable `i` changes each time (this is called aa loop counter)\n",
    "- `\"Hello!\"` is printed 5 times\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✏️ Your Turn\n",
    "1. Write a `for` loop that runs 3 times\n",
    "2. Print `\"Learning Python!\"` each time\n",
    "3. Observe how many times it prints"
